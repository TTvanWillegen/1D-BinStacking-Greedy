# Pipefitter
## Just a simple website
A friend of mine needed a way to (near-)optimally cut pipes from larger pipes.
This webpage solves that by using a greedy algorithm on the 1D version of the bin stacking problem.

## How can I use it?
You simply copy index.html and calculator.js to your server; that's all!
